# FAST_LIO_SLAM_LCD

## A Robust and Effective LiDAR-SLAM System with Learning-based Denoising and Loop Closure


## Front_end : Fast LiDAR-Inertial Odometry + D-Net   Back_end Tightly-coupled Lidar Inertial Odometry + LC-Net: 


## Summary of the merits of our works based on previous works:

1.[FAST-LIO2]: The tightly coupled lio slam system lacks global consistency because of its lack of front-end. Refer to the back-end part of lio_sam and connect to GTSAM for back-end optimization.



3.Added on the basis of FAST_LIO_SLAM: 1. Euclidean distance-based loop detection search based on Radius Search, which increases the robustness of loop closure search; 2. The optimization result of loop detection is updated to the current frame pose of FAST-LIO2, and Refactor ikdtree to update subma.

## The additional Contributions  

1. Use the externally connected PGO loopback detection module for back-end optimization. FAST_LIO_SAM transplants the back-end GTSAM optimization part of LIO-SAM to the code of FAST-LIO2, and the data transmission and processing link is clearer.

2. Add keyframe saving, and save maps and tracks through rosservice commands.

3.The back-end optimization in FAST_LIO_SLAM only uses the high-level GPS for constraints. The high-level GPS is generally noisy, so the XYZ three-dimensional postion of GPS is added to constrain the GPS a priori factor.

when you want to see the path in the Map [satellite map](http://dict.youdao.com/w/satellite map/#keyfrom=E2Ctranslation)，you can also use [Mapviz](http://wiki.ros.org/mapviz)p  plugin .

## Attention:

1.In FAST-LIO2, the pose attitude is represented by so3, while in gtsam, the input relative_pose attitude is expressed in Euler RPY form, which needs to be converted and updated using Rodriguez's formula.

2. iktree  reconstruct 

3.In the walking data set, because some data are constantly holding the rotating lidar at the same place, the angle of the rotating lidar reaches the threshold for saving key frames. In a short period of time, multiple similar key frames are saved, causing ISAM2 to appear. If the feature degrades and the odometer runs away, the threshold parameters for key frame selection can be adjusted appropriately according to the data set.

4.Add the diamante part of the GPS prior prior factor, refer to the prior factor part of lio_sam, compared withFAST-LIO-SLAM, FAST-LIO-SLAM only uses the high-level constraints of GPS, and does not use constraints in the xy direction. However, the error of GPS in the high layer (Z axis) is relatively large, and it is easy to introduce errors in the optimization process.

5.Among the GPS prior factors, **"useGpsElevation"** selects the high-level constraint of GPS, which is not used by default, because the high-level noise of GPS is relatively large.

6.LIO-SAM uses **ekf_localization_node** this ROS Package to transfer the GPS WGS84 coordinate system to the World system. FAST-LIO-SAM considers decoupling with the external ROS package as much as possible, and calls **GeographicLib** for coordinate conversion.
